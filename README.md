Recently I read a New York Times article on land subsidence in the tidewater region of Virginia and the related over pumping of the Potomac Aquifer. As a Virginia resident this got me thinking about how groundwater sources are monitored in the state I call home.

## The Data

   The USGS happens to have current condition data on 193 groundwater stations in Virginia monitoring the depth to water level in feet. The records are not instantaneous but rather give a latest updated depth from a few minutes to an hour from when you are accessing the dashboard. [usgs current conditions for groundwater](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/va/nwis/current/?type=gw).

## Work 

## Future Work
5. **Automate retrieval of USGS water Data** 
   - I want to use a crontab to get the virginia groundwater monitoring depth data daily so that I can start to analzye changes over time and compare by county
